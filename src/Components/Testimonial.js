                    SOSO is one of the school I’m thankful for in my life. I'd
                    spent three years in SOSO and I can say it’s one of the best
                    moments in my life. The staffs are accommodating and very
                    excellent at their job. The teachers don’t just teach, they
                    mentor students. They make education fun and understandable
                    for learners. I’m able to achieve a lot of things at School
                    of science Ogbomoso. It is the best school in Ogbomoso.
                    ENROLL WITH SOSO AND YOU WILL BE PROUD YOU DID.
